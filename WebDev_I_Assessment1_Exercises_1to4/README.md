# Web Dev 1 â€” Exercises (Pro+)

This pack contains four upgraded exercises with professional touches:

- **Semantic markup** (Exercise 1)
- **CSS styling & layout** (Exercise 2)
- **Responsive media gallery** (Exercise 3)
- **Accessible photo cards** (Exercise 4)

## Highlights
- Accessible landmarks, headings, keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`), skip links
- Responsive layouts (Grid/Flex), containerized widths
- **Dark/Light theme toggle** (stored in `localStorage`)
- Reduced motion support, print styles
- Image width/height to prevent layout shift + basic `srcset/sizes`

## How to use
Open each `index.html` file in a browser. Edit `styles.css` to customise colours, spacing, or type.
